    "The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) is called the `shebang`, and it indicates the path to the interpreter used to execute this script. This is necessary any time execution of the script is required. Regardless of how you plan to run your Bash script, it’s best to include a shebang line. By default, a shell script containing a command that fails (exits with a nonzero exit status) will not cause the entire shell script to exit — the shell script will just continue on to the next line. This is not a desirable behavior; we always want errors to be loud and noticeable!\n",
    "\n",
    "`set -e` prevents this, by terminating the script if any command exited with a nonzero exit status. Note, however, that `set -e` has complex rules to accommodate cases when a nonzero exit status indicates “false” rather than failure. For example, `test -d file.txt` will return a nonzero exit status if its argument is not a directory, but in this context this isn’t meant to represent an error. `set -e` ignores nonzero statuses in if conditionals for this reason (we’ll discuss this later). Also, `set -e` ignores all exit statuses in Unix pipes except the last one — this relates to `set -o pipefail`, which we'll circle back to.\n",
    "\n",
    "`set -u` fixes another unfortunate default behavior of Bash scripts: any command containing a reference to an unset variable name will still run. As a horrifying example of what this can lead to, consider: `rm -rf $TEMP_DIR/*`. If the shell variable `$TEMP_DIR` isn’t set, Bash will still substitute its value (which is nothing) in place of it. The end result is `rm -rf /*`! You can see this for yourself: `$ echo \"rm $NOTSET/blah\" rm /blah set -u` prevents this type of error by aborting the script if a variable’s value is unset. As just discussed, `set -e` will cause a script to abort if a nonzero exit status is encountered, with some exceptions. One such exception is if a program run in a Unix pipe exited unsuccessfully; unless this program was the last program in the pipe, this would not cause the script to abort even with `set -e`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including `set -o pipefail` will prevent this undesirable behavior — any program that returns a nonzero exit status in the pipe will cause the entire pipe to return a nonzero status. With `set -e` enabled, too, this will lead the script to abort.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three options are the first layer of protection against Bash scripts with silent errors and unsafe behavior. Unfortunately, Bash is a fragile language, and we need to mind a few other oddities to use it safely."
